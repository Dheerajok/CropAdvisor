üåø Agro-Insight: The Modern Farmer's Digital Toolkit
Agro-Insight is an all-in-one web platform designed to empower farmers with data-driven tools and modern technology. From intelligent crop suggestions to AI-powered disease detection, this project aims to boost productivity, increase yield, and make farming more sustainable and profitable.
‚ú® Core Features
Our platform integrates several powerful modules into a single, easy-to-use dashboard:
‚Ä¢	üìä Personalized Dashboard: A central hub providing an at-a-glance overview of local weather, crop health alerts, and key farming tasks.
‚Ä¢	üåæ Smart Crop Recommendation: Leverages soil data (NPK, pH), climate conditions, and location to recommend the most suitable crops for cultivation.
‚Ä¢	üî¨ AI-Powered Disease Detection: Instantly diagnose crop diseases by simply uploading a photo of an affected leaf. Our machine learning model identifies the issue and suggests remedial actions.
‚Ä¢	üå± Fertilizer Recommendation: Calculates the optimal type and quantity of fertilizer required based on soil analysis and the selected crop, preventing overuse and saving costs.
‚Ä¢	‚òÄÔ∏è Real-Time Weather Forecast: Provides current weather conditions, hourly updates, and a 7-day forecast to help farmers plan their activities like irrigation and harvesting.
‚Ä¢	üìñ Comprehensive Farming Guides: An in-built encyclopedia with step-by-step guides, best practices, and information for a wide variety of crops.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites
‚Ä¢	Node.js (v18 or later)
‚Ä¢	Python (v3.9 or later) & pip
‚Ä¢	A database instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas or a local PostgreSQL server)
‚Ä¢	API Key from a weather provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
Installation & Setup
1.	Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agro-insight.git
cd agro-insight
2.	Backend Setup:
Bash
cd backend
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file and add your configuration
cp .env.example .env
Now, edit the .env file with your Database URI and Weather API Key.
3.	Frontend Setup:
Bash
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env.local file for environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
Edit .env.local to include the URL of your running backend server (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000).
Running the Application
1.	Start the Backend Server:
Bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
flask run
The backend will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
2.	Start the Frontend Application:
Open a new terminal window.
Bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application.
